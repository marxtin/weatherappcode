## Typescript and React Weather App

## [weather app](https://marxtin.github.io/weatherApp)

I use the https://openweathermap.org/ API to display current and forecast weather data, as well as the time. Since openweatherorg sends Unix time as a response, I calculate the locations's local time according to timezone. 

For styling, I mainly used https://styled-components.com/ which allows for a nice and solid theming and adapting based on props. 

For accessing and modifying LocalStorage I used a hook from https://usehooks-ts.com/. 

https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/ helped me with some icons.
